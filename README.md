Black Friday Sales – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Black Friday sales dataset to understand customer purchasing behavior and identify patterns across demographics, product categories, and spending habits.
The analysis focuses on answering questions such as:
Which customer groups spend the most?
How do age, gender, and marital status affect purchases?
Which product categories generate higher sales?
